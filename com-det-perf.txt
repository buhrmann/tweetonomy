Performance of community detection algorithms on whole graph (largest weak component):

Info map:       3.88 min (very different from louvain and fast_greedy !!!)
Fast-greedy:    14.7 mins
Walktrap:       Too long (needs > 10gb of memory...)
Multi-level:    ~2 sec (linear)
Louvain:        ~2 sec (same algo as multi-level)   
Labelprop:      Doesn't terminate it seems
