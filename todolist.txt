Social Network Autonomy:
 ☐ Combined graph layers duplicate tweets as some will be both a retweet and a mention !!!
 ✔ Finish refactoring of hashtag_freq functions to use day_users instead of more costly, but unnecessary (confirm!) day_graph! @done (15-10-23 19:00)
 ☐ !!!Check whether to use strength() instead of degree everywhere (i.e. #tweets not #different users retweeted)!!!
 ☐ Make all mode/layer dependent functions also apply to "both" kinds.
 ☐ Cache R, M and B global networks separately!
 ☐ Overview of all current analytics. Dynamic report?
 ☐ Determine and select two separate periods (catalan elections, general elections)
 ☐ Limit geo, limit language ?
 ☐ Do hashtag series for mention network and combined network
 ☐ Time resolution of time series
 ☐ Sentiment analysis applied to media consumption
 ☐ Keyword extraction (e.g. Garcia2015)
 ☐ Compare retweet, mention and combined networks
   ☐ To compare retweets and mentions, calculate overlap of two networks (Jaccard coefficient, see Garcia 2015).§
 ☐ Small world? Scale-free?
 ☐ In hashtags-by-user consider actual number of hashtag occurences (at the moment only presence is returned)?
 ☐ Compare communities:
   ☐ hashtag popularity 
   ☐ content: messages(hashtags) more similar within community than across? (Conover2011)
 ☐ Pick two hashtags and calculate transfer entropy between communities
