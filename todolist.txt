Social Network Autonomy:
 ☐ Compare com. algos on global network (seems louvain is best?)
 ☐ Break down of node neighbourhood affiliation
 ☐ Cache global network and communities, along with basic stats (#N, #E, etc.), mention, retweet and combined!
 ☐ Small world? Scale-free?
 ☐ In hashtags-by-user consider actual number of hashtag occurences (at the moment only presence is returned)?
 ☐ Reconsider tracked users and keywords
 ☐ Compare communities:
   ☐ densities, #nodes, #edges, average degree, average link embeddedness (social cohesion:Arnau), 
   ☐ hashtag popularity 
   ☐ extract largest clique, core (compare size of largest e.g.)
   ☐ content: messages(hashtags) more similar within community than across? (Conover2011)
   ☐ hierarchical structure (Aragon2015): 
     ☐ gini coefficient
     ☐ in-degree centrality
   ☐ information efficiency (Aragon2015):
     ☐ average path length (short in small world)
     ☐ clustering coefficient (large in small world)
   ☐ social resilience (Aragon2015):
     ☐ k-core decomposition

 ☐ Measure modularity
 ☐ Compare retweet, mention and combined networks
 ☐ Improve community labelling (create alternative core-members, detect largest clique/core)
 ☐ Improve community detection by running algo several times and taking majority vote or similar?
   ☐ Also try to run across days and take only those belonging to same group in at least x % of days...
   ☐ Look again at total network, identify communities, then each day filter out those nodes not in the global communities
 ☐ Plots:
   ☐ Distribution of cluster sizes (justify cutoff at 10 or whatever) and modularity (compare different algorithms)
   ☐ Interaction matrix: count of retweets between any two clusters (Aragon2015)

 ☐ Pick two hashtags and calculate transfer entropy between communities
